In the first part of this document, we will delve into the ETL processes, namely the stages of data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading onto a server.
In the final stage, we will create an actual database, or more precisely, since the data at hand consists of aggregated historical
data, a data mart, which is a specific type of data warehouse with a single fact table. Once the data mart is
created, in the second part, we will proceed to query it by exploring different solutions with various softwares
such as Microsoft SSIS, SQL, and Extended SQL. Finally, in the third part, after constructing the OLAP cube
with Microsoft SSAS, we will address additional analysis queries using the MDX language, a structured language
designed specifically for exploring data warehouse hierarchies.
